# GROUP 2 - CFG PROJECT 
## What Are We Building?
We're creating an innovative travel and budgeting website to help travellers plan their trips more efficiently and economically, including a feature that automatically calculates and distributes shared expenses among travel group members. Our platform combines comprehensive trip planning tools with excellent usability, allowing users to explore new destinations without worrying about budgeting group expenses. 

## How We're Staying Organised: 
Please look at the audit txt file to see a log of all our group discussions.
