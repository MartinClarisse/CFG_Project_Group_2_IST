# GROUP 2 - CFG PROJECT 
## General Idea:
We are creating a web app which allows groups of friends to input costs for a holiday. 
The users are then able to incrementally pay in to their contrubution of costs. 
They will be alerted to payment milestones. 

## What We're Up To: 
Please look at the audit txt file to see a log of all our group discussions. 
More information will be shared by Jessie with the more detailed plan.
