# GROUP 2 - CFG PROJECT 
## What Are We Building?
We're creating an innovative travel and budgeting website to help travellers plan their trips more efficiently and economically, including a feature that automatically calculates and distributes shared expenses among travel group members. Our platform combines comprehensive trip planning tools with excellent usability, allowing users to explore new destinations without worrying about budgeting group expenses. 
Users can interact with their accounts through the python console, and all their data is stored in a SQL database. 

### How We're Staying Organised: 
Please look at the "meeting_minutes.txt" file in the "Documentation" folder to see a log of all our group discussions minutes. 
Our group is formed of Chahat, Jessie and Clarisse.

### IMPORTANT: Branches in development
#### üö®Developing Webapp
This is a very important branch of this repository, as this contains the version of this project with all of the HTML/CSS and flask. 
Due to time constraints, our group had to pivot from a webapp to a console app. 
However, please open this branch to understand how the python console mimics the functionality which we had designed in the 'website' worktree. 
This file also includes the working API. 
You can find the relevant files in the 'website' directory. 
Please also watch the mock data demonstration to understand the user journey through the webpages. This is in the main repository of this development branch, titled'HTML Demo.mp4'. You may need to download this to play due to file size. 

## Follow Along:

### ‚ùóProject Documentation

Please read the 'Project Documentation' file in the 'Documentation' folder. 

### ‚ùóVisualising the Code:
To familiarise yourself with the technical architecture, please enter the 'Documentation' repository. in which you can view 
Here you can find:
- Visuals of the design architecture in the 'Visualising the Code' folder. This shows the original webapp design and it's replication within python logic. 
- Records of the group meeting in 'minute_meetings.txt".
- A record of our group assignment handin. 

### ‚ùóHow to Install and Run Project: 
For relevant dependencies:
- Begin by checking the requirements.txt file. 
To run the project:
- Clone all this repository to your local device.
- Run the SQL script "Creating SQL Database.sql" from the "SQL_files" folder in mySQL first to initalise the schema and populate the 'dud' values. 
- Open the console repository with all files in Pycharm.
- NB: Please make sure to edit the "db.py" file to update the passwd to your mySQL password for the connection to work. 
- Ensure you have have installed the relevant dependencies within this directory in the python terminal.
- Run the main.py file.
- Navigate the application within the python console.
