# GROUP 2 - CFG PROJECT 
## What Are We Building?
We're creating an innovative travel and budgeting website to help travellers plan their trips more efficiently and economically, including a feature that automatically calculates and distributes shared expenses among travel group members. Our platform combines comprehensive trip planning tools with excellent usability, allowing users to explore new destinations without worrying about budgeting group expenses. 
The front-end uses HTML templates and CSS, and it's connected to python through flask, and all the data is stored on a SQL database through mysql.connector. 

### How We're Staying Organised: 
Please look at the "audit.txt" file in the "Documentation" folder to see a log of all our group discussions minutes. 
Our group is formed of Chahat, Jessie and Clarisse.

### Branches Being Worked On:
#### Add-Python-Code
This is where we are currently getting the python to talk to the HTML and SQL. 
The connection to the SQL database is working through the python console. 
We have been having issues between the HTML and python with flask which we are working on too.
