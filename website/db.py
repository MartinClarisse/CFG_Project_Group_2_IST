# This file has functions for connecting to the database, then querying and closing it.
# This means the functions can be called in the models file without needing to be repeated each time.
# For example, you would just import * functions then just define the query and pass it through the query_db function.

# This function connects to the database
# ‚ùóNB: The password needs to be changed for programmer's own MySQL log in to connect.
