# Need 5 examples of things being tested.

# Here is the example I used in the exam which we can remodel for the code in these files:

# from unittest import mock, main, TestCase
# from main import handshakes
#
# # TESTING THAT THE HANDSHAKE FUNCTION WORKS
#
# class TestHandshakes(TestCase):
#
#     def test_1_person(self):
#         expected = 0
#         result = handshakes(1)
#         self.assertEqual(expected,result)
